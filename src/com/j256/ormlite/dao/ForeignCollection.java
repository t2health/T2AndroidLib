/**
 * Collection that is set on a field that as been marked with the {@link ForeignCollectionField} annotation when an

 * <b>NOTE:</b> If the collection has been marked as being "lazy" then just about all methods in this class result in a
 * pass through the database using the {@link #iterator()}. Even {@link #size()} and other seemingly simple calls can
 * cause a lot of database I/O. Most likely just the {@link #iterator()}, {@link #toArray()}, and
 * {@link #toArray(Object[])} methods should be used if you are using a lazy collection.
